=============
1. Map Requirements
	Before you start making a map, make sure you have the following things:
		- the "Resources/Tiles" folder contains all of your tiles
		- all tiles are 20x20 PNG, TGA, or BMP
		- all trigger scripts are in the "Scripts/Triggers" folder

=============
2. Using the map maker
	To use the map maker, simple run "map maker.exe" and click "file/new."
	This will create a new map for you to begin working on.
	
	Click "file/import texture" to add tiles to your map. Once the tiles have been imported, you can select them on the right sidebar by clicking on them.
	NOTE: The map only updates when your mouse button comes up. You can click and drag to place multiple tiles, but you won't see the results until you lift the mouse button.
	
	Click the 'c' key on your keyboard or select "edit/toggle collision editing" to edit the collision map.
	From here, either click the 'd' key, or select "edit/toggle collision deleting" to delete collisions that have been placed.
	
	ADDING TRIGGERS IS CURRENTLY UNSTABLE, THEREFORE IT IS NOT COVERED BY THIS README
	
	Once your map is completed, you may click "file/save..." This will prompt a save dialog.
	NOTE: this program does NOT add file extensions. Be sure to add either ".txt" or  ".jtm" to the end of the file name!
	
	When you want to open your map again, simply click "file/load" and select your map from the dialog.
